This is the default lightgray skin from TinyMCE converted with [https://github.com/ekryski/less2sass](less2sass). After conversion these files had to be manually edited:

* Menu.scss (mix 100 instead of 200)
* Mixins.scss (@if instead of when)
* ButtonGroup.scss  (@if instead of when, @include some mixins, change , to ; in some places)
* Variables.scss (use our theme variables)
* /fonts and /img moved to ../weavy
